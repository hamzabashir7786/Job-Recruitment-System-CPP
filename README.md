# Job Recruitment System (C++ Logic + Web UI)

A hybrid **Job Recruitment Management System** that combines the power of **C++ Data Structures** with a modern **Web Interface**. This project demonstrates how backend logic and frontend presentation work together in a real-world scenario.



## Hybrid Architecture
This project is divided into two main cores to show versatility in software development:

- **Backend (C++ Engine):** Uses **Singly Linked Lists**, **Queues**, and **Bubble Sort** for high-performance data management.
- **Frontend (Web UI):** A responsive interface built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript** to provide a seamless user experience.



## Key Functionalities

### Frontend Experience (Web)
- **Dynamic Job Selection:** Applicants can select jobs from a real-time updated dropdown menu.
- **Live HR Dashboard:** Monitor total job counts and applicant statistics instantly.
- **Automatic Redirection:** Seamlessly takes the user back to the home page after a successful application.
- **GitHub Integration:** Quick access buttons to view the developer's profile and source code.

### Backend Logic (C++)
- **Singly Linked Lists:** Efficiently manages dynamic records for `Jobs` and `Applicants`.
- **Bubble Sort Algorithm:** A specialized logic to rank applicants by their **Qualification Scores**.
- **Queue Management:** Ensures a fair FIFO (First-In-First-Out) process for all incoming applications.
- **Modular Design:** Professional structure using Header (`.h`) and Implementation (`.cpp`) files.



## Project Structure
The repository is organized into distinct modules for better maintainability:

| Folder | Contents | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend/** | `Main.cpp`, `RecruitmentSystem.h/cpp`, `Job.h`, `Applicant.h` | Core logic, memory management, and sorting. |
| **Frontend/** | `Frontend.html` | User interface, forms, and HR dashboard visuals. |
| **README.md** | Documentation | Project overview and setup instructions. |
